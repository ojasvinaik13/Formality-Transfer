# Formality-Transfer

This repository hosts a custom dataset designed for fine-tuning LLMs specifically for formality transfer. It includes pairs of toxified informal sentences sourced from various social media platforms along with their corresponding intoxified formal responses. 
Additionally, it provides the procedure to fine-tune GPT models using this dataset, along with testing the fine-tuned models on custom sentences.
